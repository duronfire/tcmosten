outlook .pst/.ost databank
IMAP Account will be assigned to xxxx@xxxx.xx.ost defaultly(st.gallen@tcm-osten.ch.ost under appdata/local/microsoft/outlook). Calendar and Contacts are also stored in this file.
If account is deleted, all data will be lost!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
A xxxx.pst file has to be created for safty reason:
Under account-settings --> add xxx.pst --> set it to default --> copy all Ol-Folder-Items (i.e. Calendar, Contacts etc.) to created .pst "Store" (VBA-Object / Ol-Folder of xxx.pst) in Outlook 
--> Close Outlook --> Delete xxxxx.ost under appdata/local/microsoft/outlook --> Restart Outlook
After then, a empty xxxx@xxxxx.xxx.ost file will be created again, whereby Emails are pulled from server again and stored in it. BUT Calendar & Co. will not be created under xxxxx@xxxx.xxx.ost again!!!! --> All Calendar & Co. stored under Created .pst Store separatlly, which were copied in last step before. 

To get the "defaultfolder" Calendar Object use Application.GetNamespace("MAPI").Stores.Item("xxx name of pst").GetDefaultFolder(9).Items


Outlook category:
to enable category all Calendar & Co. must be stored in a .pst file, as written in last step.
